React Hooks have revolutionized the way developers write React components. They provide a more concise and readable way to manage state and side effects in functional components. This post explores the core hooks provided by React and their practical applications.

## Core Hooks

1. **useState**
   - `useState` allows functional components to manage state. It returns a state variable and a function to update it.

   ```jsx
   const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

2. **useEffect**

   - `useEffect` handles side effects like data fetching or DOM manipulation. It runs after the component renders and can be used to perform cleanup operations.

   ```jsx
   useEffect(() => {
   // Perform side effect
   return () => {
      // Cleanup
   };
   }, [dependencies]);

3. **useContext**

   - `useContext` provides a way to access context values in a functional component. It eliminates the need for prop drilling.

   ```jsx
   const value = useContext(MyContext);


4. **useReducer**

   - `useReducer` is an alternative to useState for managing complex state logic. It works with a reducer function similar to Redux.

   ```jsx
   const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

   By mastering React Hooks, developers can write cleaner and more maintainable code in their React applications.
